# Crackmes Solutions
My solutions to some crackmes that I have been collecting from the internet.

I have been doing (simply for fun and learn) and documented as good as I know.

I will try to classify them by different sources.

All these solutions are the result of my learning, so it is very likely that they contain some errors, of concept, of procedure or even of interpretation of the code.

## Ordered list of crackmes
1.  Win32 - **Level 0x00** - [uic-crackme0x00.md](uic/uic-crackme%200x00.md)

### Notice

I advise you to ***always use a virtual machine*** to avoid problems on your system. And also that you check the executables with an ***antivirus***, or send them to [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com) or similar tools to prevent them from sneaking a program that could be **"something more"** than a crackme.
